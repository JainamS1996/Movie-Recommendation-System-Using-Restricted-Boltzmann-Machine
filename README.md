# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine

Successfully working rbm code and flask application.

To run the project download all the necessary libraries used in the python code.

Run the rbm.py file present in the pytorch folder.

It generates the output in the form of a CSV file called "output.csv"

For better visualization of the csv file open the "output.html" file using your choice of browser.

Finally run the "app2.py" file present in the "var/www/FlaskApp/FlaskApp" directory.

This will open the web application (developed with Flask framework).

Enter the user id and the number of movie recommendations you want to display for that user.

For the sake of simplicity enter the user id and number of movie recommendation as any integer number in the range of 1 to 100.
